#  factor refers to a statistical data type used to store categorical variables

factor(vector) #gives the categories (levels) for the variable

#types of categorical variables: nominal (not implied ordered)  ordinal (implied order)

#When you first get a dataset, you will often notice that it contains factors with specific factor levels. To change the names of these levels 
R allows you to do this with the function levels()
#levels are automatically ordered alphabetically if not specified. 

levels(factor_vector) <- c("name1", "name2",...)

#Summarizing a factor
summary() #gives you a quick overview of the contents of a variable


#To create an ordered factor, you have to add two additional arguments: ordered and levels.

factor(some_vector,
       ordered = TRUE,
       levels = c("lev1", "lev2" ...))
