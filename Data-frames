#creating a dataframe

#construct a data frame with the data.frame() function. 
#As arguments, you pass the vectors to become the different columns of your data frame. 
#Because every column has the same length, the vectors you pass should also have the same length

#Selecting df elements

my_df[1,2] selects the value at the first row and second column in my_df
my_df[1:3,2:4] selects rows 1, 2, 3 and columns 2, 3, 4 in my_df

#selecting using name of column
my_df[row selection,"column name"]

#selecting entire column shortcut
my_df$column_name

#The first argument of subset() specifies the dataset for which you want a subset. 
#By adding the second argument, you give R the necessary information 
#and conditions to select the correct subset

subset(my_df, subset = some_condition)

#Sorting
#order() is a function that gives you the ranked position of each element when it is applied on a variable

a <- c(100, 10, 1000)
order(a)
[1] 2 1 3
