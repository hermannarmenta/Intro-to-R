#Constructing a matrix
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)

#The first argument is the collection of elements that R will arrange into the rows and columns of the matrix.
#Here, we use 1:9 which is a shortcut for c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
#The argument byrow indicates that the matrix is filled by the rows. 
#If we want the matrix to be filled by the columns, we just place byrow = FALSE.
#The third argument nrow indicates that the matrix should have three rows.

#Constructing matrix from a vector
matrix(vector_name, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)

#add names to rows and columns
rownames(my_matrix) <- row_names_vector
colnames(my_matrix) <- col_names_vector

# rowSums() and colSums() conveniently calculates the totals for each row or column of a matrix. 
# This function creates a new vector: rowSums(my_matrix)

#add a column or multiple columns to a matrix with the cbind() function, 
# which merges matrices and/or vectors together by column

combined_matrix <- cbind(matrix_1, matrix_2, vector_name)

#add a column or multiple columns to a matrix with the rbind() function, 
# which merges matrices and/or vectors together by row

combined_matrix <- rbind(matrix_1, matrix_2, vector_name)


#Selecting matrix elements

my_matrix[1,2] #selects the element at the first row and second column.
my_matrix[1:3,2:4] #results in a matrix with the data on the rows 1, 2, 3 and columns 2, 3, 4.

my_matrix[,1] #selects all elements of the first column.
my_matrix[1,] #selects all elements of the first row.
