#Constructing a matrix
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)

#The first argument is the collection of elements that R will arrange into the rows and columns of the matrix.
#Here, we use 1:9 which is a shortcut for c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
#The argument byrow indicates that the matrix is filled by the rows. 
#If we want the matrix to be filled by the columns, we just place byrow = FALSE.
#The third argument nrow indicates that the matrix should have three rows.
